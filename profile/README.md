#### What is TAXII?
Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII™) is an _application layer protocol_ for the communication of cyber threat information in a simple and scalable manner.

TAXII is used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI) over HTTPS. TAXII enables organizations to share CTI by defining an API that aligns with common sharing models.
TAXII is specifically designed to support the exchange of CTI represented in STIX.

#### What is STIX?
Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) is a _language_ and _serialization format_ used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI).
STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another in a consistent and machine readable manner, allowing security communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are most likely to see and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks faster and more effectively.
STIX is designed to improve many different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.
